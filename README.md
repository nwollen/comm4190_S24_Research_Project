# Project Overview

---

## Research Focus

Track and Cross-Country have always been a part of my identity. The relationships I have between my teammates and coaches could never be replicated... Or could they? This research project delves into the dynamics of ingroup and outgroup communication within the context of sport. It explores the possibility of programming an LLM to transition from the outgroup to the ingroup, mimicking the natural communication patterns and behaviors of team members. This paper aims to explore the capacity LLMs have to fit into a human ingroup.

## Methodology

The study begins with my narrative, detailing the journey from reluctance to join the cross-country team to becoming a passionate runner. It then delves into the evolution of running as an identity marker.

My research focuses on ingroup and outgroup communication dynamics, drawing on social identity theory to explain the maintenance of group norms and the perpetuation of stereotypes. The role of linguistic symbols and colloquial phrases in strengthening group cohesion is emphasized.

## Implementation

To assess the feasibility of programming an LLM to transition into the ingroup, I conducted experiments with ChatGPT, a language model. The experiments involve prompting ChatGPT to mimic both coaching and teammate interactions within a track and field team. 

---

## Findings

The findings reveal that while ChatGPT demonstrates some ability to replicate teammate interactions, particularly in casual banter and camaraderie. Its performance as a coach falls short in providing expert opinion, natural communication, and personalized guidance.

---

## Conclusion

Reflecting upon my findings, I see potential for improvement in training LLMs to navigate ingroup communication dynamics. My research and findings emphasize the importance of context, adaptability, and continued refinement in enhancing the LLM's ability to replicate human behaviors and conversations within the ingroup. 

---

The short answer is NO! LLMs could not replicate the human bonds, camaraderie, and natural conversation involved in running cross-country and track.
